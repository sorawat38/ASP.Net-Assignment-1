                Inland Marina was established in 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a
                result of the Southwest dam. From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the
                largest marina on Inland Lake. Due to the warm climate that extends year-round,
                Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the southwest. Boat owners
                from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area. Inland Marina
                has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length. Dock services include
                electrical and fresh water.
